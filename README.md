# LINGUEETUP

A mobile app to find language immersive playdates in your area!. 

The motivation behind this project was the desire to connect with other parents raising bilingual children in the United States. Young children pick up multiple languages very quickly at an early age, and I believe it is imperative to provide them an immersive experience to reinforce their learning. Playdates are the perfect way to introduce them to a language in a fun playful setting.

Adults can host events and it is encoraged to plan an activity. It could be as simple as teaching a song or hosting a puppet show! All adults are commited to only use the selected language during the entire event.

This community-driven application helps connect parents/caregivers with the common goal of fostering a second language for their children.

## Technologies
